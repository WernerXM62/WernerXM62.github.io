                <h2>Facial Recognition with Face Masks on Embedded Platform</h2>
                <p> Amidst the global COVID-19 pandemic, the necessity for effective facial recognition technology
                    that accommodates face masks became paramount. My final year project at the University of Pretoria
                    (TUKS) aimed to address this challenge by developing a facial recognition system capable of
                    accurately identifying individuals wearing face masks in real-time. This system was implemented
                    on an Odroid N2+ platform using C++ programming language, chosen for its efficiency and control
                    over system resources.</p>

                <h2>Multimodal Emotion Recognition Using AI Techniques</h2>
                <p> For my master's thesis, I delved into the exploration of artificial intelligence techniques for 
                    emotion recognition, employing multiple data modalities. The project's ambition was to create a 
                    system that could accurately identify and classify human emotions by analyzing varied sources of 
                    input data, including audio, visual, and physiological signals. The cornerstone of this system was 
                    a late fusion model, which intelligently combined the outputs of distinct AI models, each processing 
                    a different modality of data, to arrive at a comprehensive understanding of the subject's emotional 
                    state. This system was designed and implemented using the python language combined with TensorFlow 
                    and OpenCV.</p>

                <h2>Triangulating the Distance of Farm Animals Using ESPs</h2>
                <p>For our project titled "Triangulating the Distance of Farm Animals Using ESPs," we leveraged the 
                    advanced WiFi capabilities of ESP embedded systems to meticulously triangulate distances between 
                    a central pole and various farm animals in its vicinity. This innovative endeavor aimed to enhance 
                    the analysis and tracking of cattle within agricultural environments using the Signal strengh. 
                    By employing this technology, we developed a highly efficient method to monitor livestock movement 
                    and distribution across farms, offering valuable insights for farm management and operational optimization.</p>

                <h2>Furthering My Knowledge in Web Development</h2>
                <p>Embarking on the journey to design my own website served as a personal project aimed at deepening my 
                    understanding of web development. This endeavor was not just about creating a digital presence; it 
                    was a comprehensive learning experience aimed at expanding my coding skills through hands-on practice 
                    with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. By delving into HTML, I laid the foundational structure of my site, 
                    while CSS allowed me to style it appealingly. Incorporating JavaScript introduced interactivity, 
                    transforming the site from static to engaging. This project, though not aimed at developing a complex 
                    web application, became a structured exploration of web development principles, each challenge and 
                    mistake offering invaluable lessons. It significantly broadened my technical skill set, fostering a 
                    deeper appreciation for the intricacies of building and designing in the digital realm, and igniting 
                    a passion for further exploration in web development.</p>
